* Ipython is part of boarder jupyter system

# Python Scripts
* Explicitly mention print and other functions

# Python as a calculator
* Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right. For example 4**2 will give 16.
* Modulo: %. This operator returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right. For example 18 % 7 equals 4

# Objects:
Examples: Str, List, Int and so on
Everything == Object

# Functions:
predefined functions and user-defined functions
help()
complex()

# Simple yet effective codes:
\+ --> to concate

# Methods
> This is something that I dont understand fully
* Funtions that belong to objects\
* Each object has specific methods associated
* **Some methods can change the objects they are called on**
Ex: 
* Str --> capitalize() or replace()
> capitalize --> Returns string where the first letter is capitalized
> replace --> replace some parts of the string
* float --> bit_length() or conjugate()
* list --> index() or count()
> index --> gives you the index of element in a list
> count --> gives you the number of times element is repeated
